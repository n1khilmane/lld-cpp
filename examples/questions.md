🔁 Functionality & Extensibility
How would you add a new beverage (e.g., Mocha) without changing existing code?

Talk about Factory Pattern: just add a new branch or class in the factory.

Emphasize Open/Closed Principle: open to extension, closed to modification.

What if some beverages require a special brewing sequence (e.g., frothing before pouring)?

Bring up Strategy Pattern.

“Each beverage has a different prepare() logic encapsulated in a strategy.”

How would you allow users to customize sugar or milk levels?

Add optional ingredients during makeBeverage() (composition).

Maybe introduce a Customization class or decorator.

🔐 Concurrency & Multi-threading
What if 3 people press buttons at once? How does your design handle concurrency?

Acknowledge that inventory access is a shared resource.

Lock access to Inventory methods (via mutex/critical section in real systems).

You can suggest putting a thread-safe wrapper around the Inventory.

👤 User Roles
How would you handle Admin vs Customer behavior?

Suggest a basic User class with a role enum (ADMIN, CUSTOMER).

Only Admin can refill inventory or see internal logs.

🧱 Scalability & Decoupling
If we had to support 10 machines across 5 locations — how would design change?

Introduce a CoffeeMachineManager class.

Maintain a list of CoffeeMachine instances, each with their own inventory.

Persist inventory state in a DB or use a REST API layer.

What if the ingredients were managed by an external API instead of in-memory?

Abstract Inventory via an interface: IInventory.

One implementation could be InMemoryInventory, another RemoteInventoryAPI.

🧠 Design Principles / OOP
What SOLID principles are you applying here?

Single Responsibility: Each class has one purpose.

Open/Closed: Easy to add new beverages via Factory.

Liskov: If we use base class for beverage or inventory.

Interface Segregation / Dependency Inversion: You can talk about IInventory interface abstraction.

📉 Error Handling
What happens if we run out of an ingredient mid-preparation?

Return an error, roll back changes, maybe alert the admin.

Could queue the request or log a failed transaction.

🧪 Testing
How would you test this system?

Unit test beverage creation, inventory deduction, refill logic.

Use mocks to test preparation strategy or notification system.

Bonus "Think More" Interview Questions
How would you design for touch screen vs physical buttons?

What if each machine had different ingredient capacity?

How do you collect usage data and report trends?
