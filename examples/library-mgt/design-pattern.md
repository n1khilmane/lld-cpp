ðŸ§° Design Patterns You Can Talk About (With Where/Why)
1. Factory Pattern
âœ… Useful for creating User, Book, or Transaction objects based on input.

Why: Centralizes object creation, hides instantiation logic.

cpp
Copy
Edit
class UserFactory {
public:
    static User* createUser(string role, string id, string name) {
        if (role == "Member") return new Member(id, name);
        if (role == "Librarian") return new Librarian(id, name);
        return nullptr;
    }
};
Where: During user registration or setup.

2. Strategy Pattern
âœ… Useful if you want to allow different fine calculation strategies or borrow policies.

Why: Helps encapsulate behavior that can vary independently.

cpp
Copy
Edit
class FineStrategy {
public:
    virtual int calculate(string borrowDate, string returnDate) = 0;
};

class StandardFineStrategy : public FineStrategy {
public:
    int calculate(string borrowDate, string returnDate) override {
        // same logic from before
    }
};
Where: You can inject different strategies for members vs guests.

3. Observer Pattern
âœ… Useful if you want to notify users (email/SMS) when a reserved book is returned.

Why: Decouples notification logic from return/borrow logic.

cpp
Copy
Edit
class Observer {
public:
    virtual void notify(string message) = 0;
};

class MemberNotifier : public Observer {
public:
    void notify(string message) override {
        cout << "Notification: " << message << endl;
    }
};
Where: On returnBook, notify waitlisted members.

4. Singleton Pattern
âœ… Useful to ensure there's only one instance of the Library object.

Why: A library is a central manager; you usually donâ€™t want multiple instances.

cpp
Copy
Edit
class Library {
private:
    static Library* instance;
    Library() {} // private constructor

public:
    static Library* getInstance() {
        if (!instance)
            instance = new Library();
        return instance;
    }
};
Library* Library::instance = nullptr;
Where: System-wide access to a single Library instance.

5. Decorator Pattern
âœ… Useful if you want to add optional features like premium members, priority borrow, etc.

Why: Adds behavior without modifying base class.

cpp
Copy
Edit
class MemberDecorator : public Member {
protected:
    Member* member;
public:
    MemberDecorator(Member* m) : Member(m->userId, m->name), member(m) {}
};

class PremiumMember : public MemberDecorator {
public:
    PremiumMember(Member* m) : MemberDecorator(m) {}

    void accessLounge() {
        cout << "Accessing premium lounge\n";
    }
};
Where: When extending Member behavior dynamically.

6. Command Pattern
âœ… Useful if you want to implement undo for borrow/return, or queue library actions.

Why: Encapsulates operations as objects.

cpp
Copy
Edit
class Command {
public:
    virtual void execute() = 0;
};

class BorrowCommand : public Command {
    Library* lib;
    string memberId, barcode, date;
public:
    BorrowCommand(Library* l, string m, string b, string d) : lib(l), memberId(m), barcode(b), date(d) {}
    void execute() override {
        lib->borrowBook(memberId, barcode, date);
    }
};
Where: If you're building an admin panel or action history.

ðŸŽ¯ Which Ones Should You Definitely Mention?
For SDE1 rounds, these are must-know and easy to justify:

Pattern	Easy to Explain	Relevant to Library	Shows Design Thinking
Factory	âœ…	âœ…	âœ…
Strategy	âœ…	âœ…	âœ…
Singleton	âœ…	âœ…	âœ…
Observer	Medium	âœ…	âœ…
Decorator	Medium-Hard	âœ… (Premium members)	âœ…

Would you like a version of the code that implements 1â€“2 of these patterns cleanly (like Factory + Strategy), or help with how to explain them briefly in interview answers?
